## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**Claude Code Game Studios** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 49 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

### YJackGameStudio: Owner-Directed Autonomous Studio OS

> **YJackGameStudio is an owner-directed autonomous game studio OS for agentic game development.**

When used as YJackGameStudio, this system goes beyond a collaborative assistant template:

- The owner states a game goal, selects an autonomy mode, and the studio creates
  structured, dependency-aware, validation-aware issues with routing to the right
  specialist agents.
- Work is tracked as explicit **work contracts** — not chat history.
- Agents operate within owner-set boundaries: they do not claim unlimited autonomy.
  HIGH-risk decisions always require owner approval.

YJackGameStudio can operate in two configurations:

| Configuration | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Standalone** | Generic multi-agent game studio for any engine |
| **Integrated with YJackCore** | Full studio OS for games built on the YJackCore Unity framework |

**The split when integrated:**

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **YJackCore** | Unity runtime/editor authoring framework (`com.ygamedev.yjack`) |
| **YJackGameStudio** | Autonomous AI production/studio layer — planning, contracts, ownership, validation, routing |

YJackCore is the authority for Unity package files, layer architecture, and the low-code authoring substrate. YJackGameStudio consumes YJackCore guidance. It does not modify YJackCore package files unless the owner explicitly authorizes a framework change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Recommended**: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for hook validation) and Python 3 (for JSON validation)

All hooks fail gracefully if optional tools are missing — nothing breaks, you just lose validation.

### Setup

1. **Clone or use as template**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git my-game
   cd my-game
   ```

2. **Open Claude Code** and start a session:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Run `/start`** — the system asks where you are (no idea, vague concept,
   clear design, existing work) and guides you to the right workflow. No assumptions.

   Or jump directly to a specific skill if you already know what you need:
   - `/brainstorm` — explore game ideas from scratch
   - `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — configure your engine if you already know
   - `/project-stage-detect` — analyze an existing project

## Upgrading

for step-by-step migration instructions, a breakdown of what changed between
versions, and which files are safe to overwrite vs. which need a manual merge.

production/                         # Sprint plans, milestones, release tracking
```

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Autonomy Modes

The system supports three modes. The default is **collaborative**.

| Mode | Owner Touchpoints | When to Use |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Collaborative** (default) | Every step — Ask → Options → Decide → Draft → Approve | All new projects; any time you want full visibility |
| **Supervised Autonomous** | Sprint start, sprint end, HIGH-risk gates | When you've pre-approved a sprint scope and trust the agents to execute |
| **Trusted Autonomous** | HIGH-risk gates + async status reports | Standing mandate; owner reviews milestones and escalations only |

**HIGH-risk actions are owner-gated in every mode.** This includes architecture changes, framework package edits, scope expansion, and release actions.

Set the mode in your work contract (`autonomy_mode` field) or in `production/autonomy-config.md`. When in doubt, default to collaborative.

See [`.agents/docs/autonomy-modes.md`](.agents/docs/autonomy-modes.md) for full definitions.

You stay in control. Agents provide structure, decompose work, and surface options — they do not operate without boundaries.

### Automated Safety

**Hooks** run automatically on every session:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `validate-commit.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Checks for hardcoded values, TODO format, JSON validity, design doc sections — exits early if the command is not `git commit` |
| `validate-push.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Warns on pushes to protected branches — exits early if the command is not `git push` |
| `validate-assets.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Validates naming conventions and JSON structure — exits early if the file is not in `assets/` |
| `session-start.sh` | Session open | Shows current branch and recent commits for orientation |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session open | Detects fresh projects (suggests `/start`) and missing design docs when code or prototypes exist |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Before compaction | Preserves session progress notes |
| `post-compact.sh` | After compaction | Reminds Claude to restore session state from `active.md` |
| `notify.sh` | Notification event | Shows Windows toast notification via PowerShell |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session close | Archives `active.md` to session log and records git activity |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent spawned | Audit trail start — logs subagent invocation |
| `log-agent-stop.sh` | Agent stops | Audit trail stop — completes subagent record |
| `validate-skill-change.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Advises running `/skill-test` after any `.claude/skills/` change |

> **Note**: `validate-commit.sh`, `validate-assets.sh`, and `validate-skill-change.sh` fire on every Bash/Write tool call and exit immediately (exit 0) when the command or file path is not relevant. This is normal hook behavior — not a performance concern.

**Permission rules** in `settings.json` auto-allow safe operations (git status, test runs) and block dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env` files).

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Tune hooks** — adjust validation strictness, add new checks
- **Pick your engine** — use the Godot, Unity, or Unreal agent set (or none)
- **Set review intensity** — `full` (all director gates), `lean` (phase gates only), or `solo` (none). Set during `/start` or edit `production/review-mode.txt`. Override per-run with `--review solo` on any skill.

## Platform Support

Tested on **Windows 10** with Git Bash. All hooks use POSIX-compatible patterns (`grep -E`, not `grep -P`) and include fallbacks for missing tools. Works on macOS and Linux without modification.
